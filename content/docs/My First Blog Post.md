## Why I Use Obsidian for Everything (And You Might Want To)

	“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen

When I first started taking notes seriously, I bounced between apps — Google Keep, Notion, Evernote, even paper journals. But nothing quite stuck. Then I found Obsidian.

And it changed everything.


## What Is Obsidian?

Obsidian is a markdown-based note-taking app that treats your notes like a personal knowledge base. It stores your content in plain .md files, meaning you own your notes forever — no cloud lock-in, no proprietary formats.

But the real magic?

    Backlinks + Graph View
    Your ideas aren’t just “files” — they’re nodes in a network.
    With every link you create, you build your own private Wikipedia of thought.


## How I Use Obsidian

Here’s how I’ve been using Obsidian daily:

    📖 Class Notes: Each subject is a vault, chapters as notes.

    🧩 DSA Prep: Each problem or concept links to a tag and related logic.

    🌱 Digital Garden: Draft blog ideas like this post.

    🧠 Second Brain: Collect quotes, life lessons, and random ideas.

    🔗 Linking Thoughts: “Ideas don't live in folders — they live in relationships.”

## My Favourite Plugins

Obsidian becomes even better with plugins. My current favourites:

    Dataview: Create custom dashboards or to-do views.

    Calendar: Great for journaling.

    Templater: Automate repetitive note-taking patterns.

    Minimal Theme + Style Settings: Clean and aesthetic.

## Why You Should Try It

If you're someone who:

    Learns better by writing and connecting ideas,

    Wants a tool that grows with you, not against you,

    Likes privacy and local control,
    then Obsidian is more than an app — it’s a mindset.

## What’s Next?

I plan to share more about how I structure notes for learning, productivity, and even startup ideas. If you’re interested in building your own second brain — stick around. ✌️
