# The Hardest Step is the First step

>*“You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar*

For the longest time, I hesitated to start a blog.

Not because I didn’t want to share—but because I thought I needed to be “ready.” Maybe after mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Or after solving 500 problems on LeetCode. Or after building a perfect portfolio. But to be really honest, I realised that I could never find that perfect time to suffice my perfectionist personality. And, I do believe that this is one of my most important discoveries in life...

The fact that: **there is no perfect time to start**—except now.

# What led me to start a blog

It all began when I realized I was learning so many new things every day - whether while debugging a piece of code, understanding a tricky DSA question, or setting up a personal project like this very blog. I felt a need to:

- Document what I **learn**
    
- Reflect on my **growth**
    
- **Help** others who are walking the same path

I have always been fond of teaching. As a human being, I feel that it is one of duties to help others of our own kind, and in this **selfish** world I believe **kindness** has slowly began starting to **vanish**. But, back to the topic, These points are primarily what drove me to start blogging. Regardless of who **judges** me, **criticises** me, I wish to build this space for the sake of it.

# The Twist — Why I Didn’t Choose the Easy Route

When I finally decided to start blogging, I didn’t want to go the conventional route—like WordPress, Medium, or some drag-and-drop editor.

I chose the harder path on purpose.

Instead of using pre-made platforms, I decided to build my blog using the very skills I’ve been learning—**coding**. I set it up with **Hugo**, a static site generator, and connected it to my **Obsidian notes** so I could write and publish directly from my personal vault. All hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

Sounds like a lot of effort? It was.  
But to me, it felt **right**.

Why? Because I didn't just want to write—I wanted the process of writing itself to reflect my identity as a **developer**.

Most people might wonder:

> *"Why complicate things when there are so many simpler options?"*

But I believe in building the kind of workflow that grows **with me**, not against me. I saw it as an investment—making things a bit harder now so they become **effortless** later.

And most importantly: it made the whole thing **mine**. My system. My process. My voice.

Yes, obsidian is a well known note taking platform. Yes, Hugo, is a well known static site builder. Yes, GitHub Pages is a well known platform for aspiring bloggers like me. But, the way to connect all of it, only a **handful** (LOL) hundred thousand people know about it.

## Obsidian

### What is Obsidian?

**Obsidian** is a powerful, minimalist note-taking app that lets you write in **Markdown** and organize your notes in a local folder.

Unlike typical note apps, Obsidian works like a **personal knowledge base**—it lets you create internal links (`[[like this]]`), graph connections between ideas, and treat your notes like a second brain.

### Why I Use Obsidian for Blogging

For me, Obsidian isn’t just a place to jot thoughts—it’s where I:

- Write drafts in Markdown
    
- Link ideas across blog posts
    
- Organize my thoughts without distraction
    
- Sync with my Hugo blog setup for seamless publishing
    

It keeps everything **offline**, fast, **and** fully in my **control**.

Just like this blog that I was drafting Obsidian before posting it on this blog!
