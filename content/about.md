Hey! I'm Abeer — a developer with a passion for solving problems, learning, and standing out. Curious by nature, I’m always building, exploring, and sharing. Whether it’s coding, writing, or crafting ideas, I enjoy bringing clarity and creativity to everything I do. Outside the screen, you’ll find me playing football, strategizing over chess, or sipping some good ol' coffee. This blog is where I share my tech journey — one note at a time.
