Or after solving 500 problems on LeetCode. Or after building a perfect portfolio. But to be really honest, I realised that I could never find that perfect time to suffice my perfectionist personality. And, I do believe that this is one of my most important discoveries in life\u0026hellip;\nThe fact that: there is no perfect time to start—except now.\nWhat led me to start a blog It all began when I realized I was learning so many new things every day - whether while debugging a piece of code, understanding a tricky DSA question, or setting up a personal project like this very blog. I felt a need to:\nDocument what I learn\nReflect on my growth\nHelp others who are walking the same path\nI have always been fond of teaching. As a human being, I feel that it is one of duties to help others of our own kind, and in this selfish world I believe kindness has slowly began starting to vanish. But, back to the topic, These points are primarily what drove me to start blogging. Regardless of who judges me, criticises me, I wish to build this space for the sake of it.\nThe Twist — Why I Didn’t Choose the Easy Route When I finally decided to start blogging, I didn’t want to go the conventional route—like WordPress, Medium, or some drag-and-drop editor.\nI chose the harder path on purpose.\nInstead of using pre-made platforms, I decided to build my blog using the very skills I’ve been learning—coding. I set it up with Hugo, a static site generator, and connected it to my Obsidian notes so I could write and publish directly from my personal vault. All hosted via GitHub Pages.\nSounds like a lot of effort? It was.\nBut to me, it felt right.\nWhy? Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t just want to write—I wanted the process of writing itself to reflect my identity as a developer.\nMost people might wonder:\n\u0026ldquo;Why complicate things when there are so many simpler options?\u0026rdquo;\nBut I believe in building the kind of workflow that grows with me, not against me. I saw it as an investment—making things a bit harder now so they become effortless later.\nAnd most importantly: it made the whole thing mine. My system. My process. My voice.\nYes, obsidian is a well known note taking platform. Yes, Hugo, is a well known static site builder. Yes, GitHub Pages is a well known platform for aspiring bloggers like me. But, the way to connect all of it, only a handful (LOL) hundred thousand people know about it.\nObsidian What is Obsidian? Obsidian is a powerful, minimalist note-taking app that lets you write in Markdown and organize your notes in a local folder.\nUnlike typical note apps, Obsidian works like a personal knowledge base—it lets you create internal links ([[like this]]), graph connections between ideas, and treat your notes like a second brain.\nWhy I Use Obsidian for Blogging For me, Obsidian isn’t just a place to jot thoughts—it’s where I:\nWrite drafts in Markdown\nLink ideas across blog posts\nOrganize my thoughts without distraction\nSync with my Hugo blog setup for seamless publishing\nIt keeps everything offline, fast, and fully in my control.\nJust like this blog that I was drafting Obsidian before posting it on this blog!\nHugo What is Hugo? Hugo is a fast, open-source static site generator written in Go. Instead of dynamically generating pages with a backend server, Hugo builds your entire website into plain HTML files that can be served anywhere—blazing fast and completely secure.\nWith Hugo, you write your content in Markdown, and it handles the layout, theme styling, navigation, and even SEO. It\u0026rsquo;s highly customizable and used by developers who want speed, control, and minimal dependencies.\nWhy I Use Hugo for building my site Hugo is the core engine that transforms my plain-text notes into a structured, styled blog.\nHere’s what it enables me to do:\nConvert Markdown to beautiful HTML with themes like PaperMod which I also used for this blog\nOrganize posts using folders and front matter (metadata like title, date, tags)\nCustomize the layout of pages exactly how I want them\nBuild the entire site instantly with a single command (hugo)\nIt fits perfectly into my writing workflow with Obsidian, where all content is already in Markdown. I can edit locally, build locally, and preview everything before it goes live.\nHugo + GitHub = Seamless Publishing This is where the magic happens.\nHugo generates the final HTML files, and I use GitHub Pages to host them for free. All I do is push the generated public/ folder (or let a GitHub Action do it automatically), and my blog is updated instantly.\nIn other words:\nObsidian → where I write\nHugo → where I build\nGitHub Pages → where I publish\nIt’s like a pipeline:\nMarkdown → Hugo → HTML → GitHub Pages → Live blog\nThis setup gives me full control over everything—from how my blog looks, to when and how it’s updated. No ads, no paywalls, no platform rules. Just code and content.\nConnecting to GitHub Pages Once Hugo generates the final version of my site (plain HTML, CSS, and JS files), I need a way to put it online. That’s where GitHub Pages comes in.\nWhat is GitHub Pages? GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that lets you deploy static websites directly from a GitHub repository. No servers, no hosting fees—just push your files, and your site is live.\nHow I Use GitHub Pages Here’s how the process works for my blog:\nI write posts in Obsidian (Markdown files).\nHugo builds them into a full website.\nI push the generated site (from the public/ folder) to a GitHub repository.\nGitHub Pages serves the site automatically to the world.\nBonus: Automating the Deploy To make things even easier, I’ve connected my main content repo to a GitHub Action—a small script that runs whenever I push changes.\nSo instead of manually running hugo and copying files, I just:\nWrite\nCommit\nPush\nBlog is live\nWhy This Matters to Me This setup:\nKeeps my workflow entirely developer-friendly\nAllows me to version control my writing like I would with code\nGives me complete control over hosting, themes, and design\nCosts me nothing to run\nIn a world full of no-code tools, I chose to build my own workflow—not because it was easy, but because it was me.\nFinal Thoughts Starting this blog wasn’t just about publishing posts—it was about taking ownership of my learning journey. From writing in Obsidian, building with Hugo, hosting on GitHub Pages, to automating everything with scripts—I’ve created a system that reflects not just what I do, but who I am as a developer.\nIt’s not perfect. It’s not flashy. But it’s mine.\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned through all of this, it’s that the hardest step is always the first. But once you take it, the path ahead doesn’t feel as scary anymore.\nSo if you’ve been waiting for the perfect moment to start your own blog, project, or passion—this is your sign:\nStart now. Build messy. Learn fast. Refine later.\nYour voice matters. And someone out there is waiting to hear it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/abeerblogs/docs/how-i-started-my-blogging-journey/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-hardest-step-is-the-first-step\"\u003eThe Hardest Step is the First step\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I hesitated to start a blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot because I didn’t want to share—but because I thought I needed to be “ready.” Maybe after mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.
