But nothing quite stuck. Then I found Obsidian.\nAnd it changed everything.\nWhat Is Obsidian? Obsidian is a markdown-based note-taking app that treats your notes like a personal knowledge base. It stores your content in plain .md files, meaning you own your notes forever — no cloud lock-in, no proprietary formats.\nBut the real magic?\nBacklinks + Graph View\rYour ideas aren’t just “files” — they’re nodes in a network.\rWith every link you create, you build your own private Wikipedia of thought.\rHow I Use Obsidian Here’s how I’ve been using Obsidian daily:\n📖 Class Notes: Each subject is a vault, chapters as notes.\r🧩 DSA Prep: Each problem or concept links to a tag and related logic.\r🌱 Digital Garden: Draft blog ideas like this post.\r🧠 Second Brain: Collect quotes, life lessons, and random ideas.\r🔗 Linking Thoughts: “Ideas don't live in folders — they live in relationships.”\rMy Favourite Plugins Obsidian becomes even better with plugins. My current favourites:\nDataview: Create custom dashboards or to-do views.\rCalendar: Great for journaling.\rTemplater: Automate repetitive note-taking patterns.\rMinimal Theme + Style Settings: Clean and aesthetic.\rWhy You Should Try It If you\u0026rsquo;re someone who:\nLearns better by writing and connecting ideas,\rWants a tool that grows with you, not against you,\rLikes privacy and local control,\rthen Obsidian is more than an app — it’s a mindset.\rWhat’s Next? I plan to share more about how I structure notes for learning, productivity, and even startup ideas. If you’re interested in building your own second brain — stick around. ✌️\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/abeerblogs/docs/my-first-blog-post/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"why-i-use-obsidian-for-everything-and-you-might-want-to\"\u003eWhy I Use Obsidian for Everything (And You Might Want To)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen\r\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first started taking notes seriously, I bounced between apps — Google Keep, Notion, Evernote, even paper journals.
