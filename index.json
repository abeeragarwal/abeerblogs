[{"content":"The Hardest Step is the First step “You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar\nFor the longest time, I hesitated to start a blog.\nNot because I didn’t want to share—but because I thought I needed to be “ready.” Maybe after mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Or after solving 500 problems on LeetCode. Or after building a perfect portfolio. But to be really honest, I realised that I could never find that perfect time to suffice my perfectionist personality. And, I do believe that this is one of my most important discoveries in life\u0026hellip;\nThe fact that: there is no perfect time to start—except now.\nWhat led me to start a blog It all began when I realized I was learning so many new things every day - whether while debugging a piece of code, understanding a tricky DSA question, or setting up a personal project like this very blog. I felt a need to:\nDocument what I learn\nReflect on my growth\nHelp others who are walking the same path\nI have always been fond of teaching. As a human being, I feel that it is one of duties to help others of our own kind, and in this selfish world I believe kindness has slowly began starting to vanish. But, back to the topic, These points are primarily what drove me to start blogging. Regardless of who judges me, criticises me, I wish to build this space for the sake of it.\nThe Twist — Why I Didn’t Choose the Easy Route When I finally decided to start blogging, I didn’t want to go the conventional route—like WordPress, Medium, or some drag-and-drop editor.\nI chose the harder path on purpose.\nInstead of using pre-made platforms, I decided to build my blog using the very skills I’ve been learning—coding. I set it up with Hugo, a static site generator, and connected it to my Obsidian notes so I could write and publish directly from my personal vault. All hosted via GitHub Pages.\nSounds like a lot of effort? It was.\nBut to me, it felt right.\nWhy? Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t just want to write—I wanted the process of writing itself to reflect my identity as a developer.\nMost people might wonder:\n\u0026ldquo;Why complicate things when there are so many simpler options?\u0026rdquo;\nBut I believe in building the kind of workflow that grows with me, not against me. I saw it as an investment—making things a bit harder now so they become effortless later.\nAnd most importantly: it made the whole thing mine. My system. My process. My voice.\nYes, obsidian is a well known note taking platform. Yes, Hugo, is a well known static site builder. Yes, GitHub Pages is a well known platform for aspiring bloggers like me. But, the way to connect all of it, only a handful (LOL) hundred thousand people know about it.\nObsidian What is Obsidian? Obsidian is a powerful, minimalist note-taking app that lets you write in Markdown and organize your notes in a local folder.\nUnlike typical note apps, Obsidian works like a personal knowledge base—it lets you create internal links ([[like this]]), graph connections between ideas, and treat your notes like a second brain.\nWhy I Use Obsidian for Blogging For me, Obsidian isn’t just a place to jot thoughts—it’s where I:\nWrite drafts in Markdown\nLink ideas across blog posts\nOrganize my thoughts without distraction\nSync with my Hugo blog setup for seamless publishing\nIt keeps everything offline, fast, and fully in my control.\nJust like this blog that I was drafting Obsidian before posting it on this blog!\n![[Pasted image 20250803093617.png]]\n","permalink":"https://abeeragarwal.github.io/abeerblogs/docs/how-i-started-my-blogging-journey/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-hardest-step-is-the-first-step\"\u003eThe Hardest Step is the First step\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I hesitated to start a blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot because I didn’t want to share—but because I thought I needed to be “ready.” Maybe after mastering Data Structures and Algorithms.
